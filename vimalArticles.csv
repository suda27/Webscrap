"Perry Barr sports hub to benefit from £500,000 upgrade after Commonwealth Games","Birmingham City Council and Sport England have come together with a £500,000 ($670,000/€600,000) plan to develop a new multi-purpose sporting facility at the Holford Drive Community Sports Hub (HDCSH) following the 2022 Commonwealth Games.","The idea is to develop a facility that can be used year-round by people in Perry Barr, the Birmingham area due to play a central role during this year's Commonwealth Games.  It is claimed that 800 people from Perry Barr and the surrounding areas use the existing HDCSH facility each week.  Yet come winter, the number drastically falls to 300 due to the lack of floodlit facilities at HDCSH.  It is hoped that winter usage will double following the renovations.  Sport England will contribute £366,685 ($495,000/€440,000) of the national lottery funding while Birmingham City Council will supply the remaining budget of £150,000 ($200,000/€180,000).  ""Local people are at the heart of our thinking when it comes to what the legacy of Birmingham 2022 will look like, and how it should provide opportunities for communities to get active,"" Sport England chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said.  ""As an important space within Perry Barr, investment to enhance Holford Drive and create a facility that can be used all year round is fantastic news, and a great example of how the impact of the Games can continue beyond 2022.""  Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward added: ""As I've said all along, the legacy of Birmingham 2022 is massively important to us - the Games are more than 11 days of sport, and we need to look at how we build on the years of good work provided for the community by brilliant organisations like Holford Drive Community Sports Hub.""  Discussions on how to get the best out of the facility during the Commonwealth Games are underway.  Work on the proposed upgrades is scheduled to begin before the end of this year.  Birmingham 2022 chair John Crabtree called the plan ""another example of how Birmingham 2022 and its partners are trying to ensure that the Commonwealth Games leaves lasting benefits for the people of the host city""."
WKF and USA Karate officials discuss sport's bid to be in Los Angeles 2028 Olympics,Senior World Karate Federation (WKF) and USA Karate officials have met to discuss the sport's bid for inclusion at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.,"An action plan was broken down during the videoconference meeting, with WKF President Antonio Espinós among those taking part.  Chief executive Sara Wolff, senior adviser Francisco Alegrete, general secretary Toshihisa Nagura, and Athletes' Commission member Elisa Au all represented the WKF.  USA Karate chair Rahul Bawa and chief executive Phil Hampel dialed in, while Au is also a USA Karate Board member.  Principles from what is being dubbed the sport's LA28 project were laid out, as the WKF prepares to lobby for a second Olympic appearance.  ""We are going to put all our efforts and work to obtain karate's inclusion in the programme of LA 2028,"" Espinós said.  ""We are convinced that karate deserves to be an Olympic sport and we are confident that karate can bring great added value to the programme of LA 2028.  ""I would like to thank the USAKF officials headed by Rahul Bawa for their contribution and unyielding support.  ""I am sure that together we will achieve great success.""  Karate made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, but is not on the programme for Paris 2024, much to the chagrin of the WKF.  Twenty-eight sports were last year recommended for inclusion at Los Angeles 2028 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board.  Modern pentathlon, boxing and weightlifting were all absent, but the IOC offered a ""pathway"" for all three to be added.  The Organising Committee can propose additional sports, but with 28 already on the programme plus those three potential additions, room is squeezed."
Vuelta a España departure to return to Barcelona in 2023 after 61-year absence,"Barcelona is set to play a major role in next year's Vuelta a España, one of cycling's three Grand Tours, including hosting the official departure.","The Catalonian city will also be the setting for second stage finish line, team presentation gala and filming of the official video clip of the La Vuelta 23.  Jaume Collboni, the Deputy Mayor of the Barcelona City Council, David Escudé, the Councillor for Sports, and Javier Guillén, general director of Vuelta a España, were all present for the announcement of the agreement.  The event, for which dates still have to be announced, will further increase Barcelona’s image as a sporting city, it is claimed.  The City Council and the race organisers are working together to focus on the city’s iconic landmarks during the first two stages of the race.  ""Today is a great day for Catalan and Spanish cycling as Barcelona is a city that has been traditionally linked with the world of sports and cycling.  To be the host of one of the three main cycling events worldwide fits perfectly with Barcelona’s international vocation,"" said Collboni.  Escudé was looking forward to the official departure of Vuelta a España, which will happen in Barcelona after a gap of 60 years.  ""A lot has happened in that time.  ""We are all for hosting large events and it makes all the sense in the world to bring La Vuelta to Barcelona, a city that is closely-linked to cycling, and has been for many years,"" he said.  Barcelona’s ties to cycling is evident as the city hosts major events like the Volta a Catalunya and the City of Barcelona International Track Cycling.  In 2009, the city also hosted two stages of the Tour de France, won by Spain's greatest cyclist Alberto Contador.  ""Cycling is a sport with a strong popular following, currently placed at number two in terms of viewing and practice within Europe. Bikes are an essential element in the sustainable development of cities, which is why we’re so thrilled to be able to participate in this project,"" La Vuelta general director Guillén said.  The Vuelta a España will also returning to Barcelona after the 2012 edition when the ninth stage of the race passed through Andorra and Montjuïc.  Belgian Philippe Gilbert emerged victorious back then.  The last time Barcelona hosted the official departure of Vuelta a España was in 1962, a stage won by Spain's Antonio Barrutia.  Next year's openings stages will be broadcast in almost 200 countries, Vuelta a España organisers claim.  A travelling caravan comprising of 2500 people, including media organisations and journalists, will be accompanying as the event goes on.  This year's Vuelta a España is due to start in Utrecht in The Netherlands on August 19 and conclude in Madrid on September 11.  Last year's race, won by Slovenia's Primož Roglič, started in Burgos on the Iberian Peninsula."

"Manager says first woman to play professional baseball in Australia ""100 per cent earned"" chance","Trailblazing baseball pitcher Genevieve Beacom says the reaction to her becoming the first woman to play in a professional game in Australia has been ""crazy"".","Beacom appeared on the latest episode of the World Baseball Softball Confederation's The Global Game podcast along with former Major League Baseball (MLB) relief pitcher Peter Moylan, who played a pivotal role in Beacom's rise to prominence.  It was Moylan who saw Beacom pitching while training with the Aces Academy, and who as a result sought to add the left-hander to the ABL Melbourne Aces as a development player.  On January 7, Beacom was called on to pitch the sixth inning of a game against the Adelaide Giants in the Melbourne Challenge Series.  The 17-year-old pitched a shutout inning, allowing no hits, and promptly shot to fame despite the Aces ultimately losing the game 7-1.  ""It seems like the whole baseball world knows me,"" Beacom told The Global Game.  ""It's crazy.  ""It's absolutely amazing.  ""I grew up watching all these guys.  ""Just to be given the offer to play was amazing.""  Moylan, who spent 12 years in MLB bullpens and is now the Aces' manager, has been watching Beacom’s development as a player since her junior days with Victoria and Australia.  ""If anyone thinks this is just a token selection, then they need to think again because she has 100 per cent earned her spot on the development list with the Melbourne Aces,"" the 43-year-old said.  Beacom is eager to collaborate with Moylan and pitching coach Graeme Lloyd, who helped the New York Yankees to World Series titles in 1996 and 1998, and also helped Australia clinch a silver medal at the Athens 2004 Olympics.  ""It's been only a couple of weeks, but I'm definitely looking forward to working with them all because they have so much baseball knowledge and experience,"" Beacom said.  Asked if she has an idol, Beacom immediately identified Jacob deGrom of the New York Mets - a four-time MLB All Star and twice a winner of the National League Cy Young Award, given to the best pitcher in the league.  ""I never tried to copy exactly a pitcher's mechanics,"" Beacom explained.  ""One I look a lot to is Jacob deGrom.  ""That guy is unbelievable.  ""He can throw so hard and looks like he's not putting any effort into it at all.""  However, New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole is ""probably my favourite pitcher"", Beacom added, ""watching him on the mound every time he gets up there [it] looks like he knows nobody is getting at him.""  Men's baseball returned to the Olympic programme after a 13-year absence at Tokyo 2020, as did women's softball.  The male-dominated world of professional baseball has made some progress in terms of gender equality in recent years, including Kim Ng becoming the the first woman to be named an MLB general manager when the Miami Marlins appointed her to the senior role in November 2020.  The same year, the San Francisco Giants made Alyssa Nakken the first full-time female coach at the MLB level, when she was appointed assistant coach and occasionally even coached at first base."

Commenting on the ban, Alex Marshall, general manager of the ICC's integrity unit, said that the experienced player knew exactly what he was doing.  ""Brendan is a former international captain who represented Zimbabwe for 17 years,"" said Marshall.  ""Over such a long career, he participated in numerous anti-corruption and anti-doping education sessions and knew exactly what his obligations were under the ICC Anti-Corruption and Anti-Doping Codes.  ""It is disappointing that a player of his experience chose not to fulfil those obligations, however he has accepted all charges, which has been reflected in the sanction.  ""I would echo Brendan’s message to other players to report approaches as soon as they happen so any corrupt activity can be disrupted at the earliest possible opportunity.  ""We wish Brendan well in his rehabilitation.""  Taylor has represented Zimbabwe in 35 Tests, 205 one-day internationals, and 45 Twenty20s.  Taylor can return to cricket on July 28 2025."

GAMMA will also hold its World Congress at the Olympic Hotel in Amsterdam on March 24, with all member federations invited to attend.  Financial statements and budgets will be reviewed at the Congress, while the organisation's activities in 2020 and 2021 and changes to the Board of Directors are also due to be up for discussion.  German capital Berlin had been supposed to host the GAMMA World Championships in December, but COVID-19 rules led to the event's postponement and ultimately a move to The Netherlands.  ""They say good things come to those who wait,"" GAMMA President Alexander Engelhardt said.

"South Korea qualify for 10th consecutive FIFA World Cup, Iran also book place","South Korea have qualified for a 10th consecutive FIFA World Cup, with Iran also booking their place at the tournament in Qatar later this year.","The duo are the first Asian countries to qualify aside from Qatar, who automatically received a berth as the host nation.  Goals from Kim Jin-su and Kwon Chang-hoon helped South Korea beat Syria 2-0 in their Group A match today.  The win at the Rashid Stadium sees South Korea advance to what will be an 11th World Cup appearance overall.  They have played at every tournament since Mexico 1986, with a fourth-place finish in 2002, the country's best-ever result, when they co-hosted with Japan.  War-torn Syria, who were not able to host the game and instead played in Sidon in Lebanon, threatened to take the lead on many occasions, and South Korea had the video assistant referee (VAR) to thank when Omar Khribin's header was ruled out for being offside.  However, Kim Jin-su headed South Korea into the lead in the 53rd minute, converting Kim Tae-hwan's cross for his second international goal, and substitute Kwon Chang-hoon doubled the lead 18 minutes later.  South Korea are second in Group A of Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifying, with 20 points from eight games.  Iran are two points ahead and booked their World Cup place on Sunday with a 1-0 triumph over Iraq.  Mehdi Taremi scored the winning goal, and also scored the winner today as Iran beat the United Arab Emirates by the same scoreline.  Both of Iran's games were played at Tehran's Azadi Stadium.  Off the pitch, it was another landmark two days for Iranian women as they were able to attend FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time since 2019.  Female fans were kept away from sporting events in Iran for more than 30 years before FIFA ordered authorities to allow women inside stadiums without restrictions.  According to the Iranian Students News Agency, 2,000 of the 10,000 tickets sold were exclusively for women.  The top two teams in each of the two groups in this final round of AFC qualifying qualify for the World Cup.  Iran and South Korea cannot be caught in Group A, with the UAE currently third on nine points.  The two third-placed teams will advance to a playoff, with the winner in turn advancing to the inter-continental playoffs.  Saudi Arabia are top of Group B, on 19 points, and Japan have 18.  Third-placed Australia are on 15, with only two rounds of fixtures remaining."
Meylemans transferred to Olympic Village after emotional post complaining of COVID-19 ordeal,"Belgian skeleton racer Kim Meylemans has been moved to the Olympic Village in Yanqing following outcry over her living conditions, and an apparent move from one COVID-19 isolation facility to another.","Meylemans, who tested positive for COVID-19 upon landing in China, claimed in a tearful Instagram post that she had been told by Beijing 2022 organisers she was free to leave a quarantine facility after three negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests.  However, Meylemans was taken to another quarantine facility rather than the Athletes' Village, which the 25-year-old claimed she had been led to believe would be her destination.  Following the plea for help on social media, Meylemans has now been moved again - this time from the second quarantine hotel to the Yanqing Olympic Village - and is being treated as a close contact, as established in the Beijing 2022 playbooks, according to the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee (BOIC).  Meylemans had earlier said she was ""not sure I can handle"" further time in an isolation facility.  The athlete will still be tested twice a day and can train, alone, on the National Sliding Centre track.  Belgium's Chef de Mission Olav Spahl said the BOIC ""completely understand Kim's reaction"".  ""Our main concern was to get Kim to the Yanqing Olympic Village as soon as possible,"" Spahl added.  ""So we're very happy that it happened.  ""We understand that COVID measures are necessary to preserve the safety and health of participants in the Olympic Games, but we believe that in this approach, the athlete must remain central.  ""We continue to work tirelessly to continue to improve Kim's situation and we remain in constant contact with her.""    In a viral post on social media made before she was relocated to the Olympic Village in Yanqing, Meylemans recalled the day's first journey she believed would take her to athletes' quarters.  ""On the way to the Village we did not turn to the Village, but the ambulance went to another facility where I am now,"" Meylemans said tearfully.  ""I am supposed to stay here for another seven days with two PCRs a day and no contact with anybody else.  ""I am allowed to slide alone.  ""We are not even sure I will ever be allowed to return to the village.  ""And obviously this is very hard for me so I ask you all to give me some time to consider my next steps because I am not sure I can handle 14 more days and the Olympic competition while being in this isolation.""  In a subsequent update from the Olympic Village, Meylemans thanked fans and fellow athletes for their support, also paying tribute to the BOIC.  ""I feel safe and I'll be able to train a little better here,"" Meylemans added.  The women's skeleton competition begins on February 11, with the first official training heats set for Monday (February 7).  Meylemans was placed 14th at Pyeongchang 2018 and also appeared at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck, representing Germany on that occasion."

"Human rights groups push for ""fair trial"" for Qatar 2022 whistleblower Ibhais again",Human Rights Watch and FairSquare have once again called for FIFA and Qatari officials to offer a fair trial for World Cup 2022 Organising Committee whistleblower Abdullah Ibhais as the case heads to Qatar’s final Court of Appeal.,"Rights groups have claimed that the judgement that upheld Ibhais’ conviction on December 5, 2021, at the appeal court has further violated his rights for a fair trial.  ""While it is Abdullah Ibhais who has been on trial, it is the Qatari justice system that should be scrutinised following such flawed judgments,"" said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.  ""The Qatari justice system is responsible for protecting the rights not just of Ibhais, but of thousands of people connected with the World Cup.""  Ibhais plans to appeal his conviction for bribery at Qatar’s Court of Cassation as he believes that the court based his conviction on a tainted confession and that it was a retaliation for his criticism of Qatar’s handling of a strike by migrant workers in 2019.  Ibhais was convicted on charges of bribery, violations of the integrity of tenders and profits, and intentional damage to public funds. The charges against Ibhais and two other defendants - Ibhais’ brother who lives in Turkey and another Saudi citizen - relate to a Supreme Committee tender for social media services.  Ibhais’ confession, which he retracted, was the sole piece of evidence considered by the appeal court. Ibhais also said the confession was extracted in a threatening environment without the presence of a lawyer. A document that claims Ibhais never specified who was supposed to represent him in the case was also presented by the appeal court.  However, a public prosecution investigative record from November 14, 2019, says that Ibhais asked to meet with a lawyer repeatedly.  The appeal court also refused a request from Ibhais’ lawyer, who was eventually hired, when he asked the prosecutors to present evidence against his client.  The appeal court said no to Ibhais’ lawyer’s request to review the evidence from the Supreme Committee in the form of voice notes, video recordings, and WhatsApp conversations between Ibhais and other defendants.  A report submitted by the Supreme Committee to the police refers to the contents of a complaint submitted in the Qatari Criminal Investigations Directorate and describes a leak of information with regards to a tender for a social media contract according to Human Rights Watch and FairSquare.  The complaint also draws a link between Ibhais, his brother from Turkey, and a Saudi citizen.  Ibhais claims that his stance in the strike organised by migrant workers led the Supreme Committee to submit sensitive allegations about how Ibhais was engaged in activities that harmed the state’s security.  Ibhais was arrested on November 12, 2019, and was forced into signing a confession, threatening him with state security charges instead of bribery and misuse of funds.  That the appeal court did not investigate about the coerced confession further shines light on the unfair judgement Ibhais received.  ""The refusal of the court to oblige the as-yet-unseen evidence to be presented in court and open to challenge, compounds their failure to afford him a fair trial,"" said Nicholas McGeehan, co-director of FairSquare.  ""It is FIFA’s position that any person deserves a trial that is fair and where due process is observed and respected,"" said a FIFA statement on Ibhais’ ordeal."
India joins diplomatic boycott of Beijing 2022 after soldier's inclusion in Olympic Torch Relay,India has announced it is joining the United States-led diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing after China decided to include a soldier involved in the border skirmish with the Indian Army in the Torch Relay.,"National broadcaster Doordarshan has also announced that they will not be broadcasting the Opening and Closing Ceremonies live.  Skier Arif Khan is the only athlete representing India in Beijing.  The US, Canada, Australia and Britain are among the countries who have decided to boycott the event to protest the alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang.  China’s decision to include Qi Fabao, a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) regiment commander who fought in the Galwan Valley border skirmish, threatens to further increase the border tensions between the two Asian countries.  India lost 20 soldiers during the clash at the Galwan Valley of Ladakh’s eastern sector in June 2020.  Four Chinese soldiers lost their lives in the clash, although there is speculation that the actual number might be more.  The Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi called the decision ""regrettable"".  ""It is indeed regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicise an event like the Olympics,"" Bagchi said.  ""I wish to inform that the Charge d’Affaires of the Embassy of India in Beijing will not be attending the Opening or the Closing Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.""  Fabao was among the 1,200 Torchbearers who carried the Olympic Flame across various venues in Beijing during its three-day Relay.  Fabao was shown on Chinese television as speed skater Wang Meng, a four-time Olympic gold medallist, handed him the Torch.  Fabao was awarded with top military honours and portrayed as a hero in state media after the clash at the border."

""This is why the IOC has urgently requested Mr Sergii Bubka, President of the NOC of Ukraine and IOC Member, to come immediately to Lausanne to coordinate all elements of humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian Olympic Community.  ""With the support of Olympic Solidarity in Lausanne and his team at the NOC in Ukraine, Mr Bubka will lead on the allocation and distribution of the solidarity fund towards the Ukrainian Olympic community and sports movement.”  According to Bach’s letter, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has reported another refugee crisis with more than one million Ukrainians displaced from their homes.  ""In the long run, the Olympic Refuge Foundation is well placed to respond to the impending impacts that this armed conflict will create on the well-being of Ukrainian people and their host communities.""

Usmanov hit with sanctions by UK Government as status of his multi-million-dollar yacht remains uncertain,"Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has been hit with sanctions by the United Kingdom Government, as uncertainty surrounds the status of his multi-million-dollar yacht, which has reportedly been seized by German authorities.","Usmanov, who has already had sanctions imposed on him by the European Union (EU), has now had his assets frozen and will be unable to travel to the UK.  British citizens and businesses will not be allowed to do deals with Usmanov, who has stepped down as the President of the International Fencing Federation following the implementation of the sanctions.  Sanctions have been imposed on Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, a former first Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, a key funder of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and President of the Organising Committee for the 2013 Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia.  After issuing the sanctions UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.  ""We won't stop here - our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin's war machine.""  The status of Usmanov’s 512-foot yacht called Dilbar, valued at nearly $600 million (£449.7 million/ €542.3 million), is unknown following the EU's sanctions on Russian oligarchs.  Forbes had reported yesterday that the luxury cruise ship was seized by German authorities in Hamburg.  However, German authorities have denied seizing the yacht.  According to Forbes, the yacht has been docked at a German shipbuilding firm called Blohm+Voss since October last year.  However, a spokesperson for Lürssen, the German shipbuilder which owns Blohm+Voss, declined to comment on the reports.  ""All orders and projects of the Lürssen Group and its subsidiaries are treated in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying by Forbes.  The expensive yacht purchased by Usmanov in 2016, was one of the ""most complex and challenging yachts"" ever built, according to Lürssen.  Apart from the yacht, Usmanov has major stakes in steel giant Metalloinvest, consumer electronics brand Xiaomi, and other companies in the telecom, mining and media industry.  Usmanov also owns multi-million-dollar luxury real-estate properties across Europe.  Yesterday, Premier League club Everton suspended partnerships with Russian firms, including USM Holdings, owned by Usmanov.  Commenting on the sanctions, Usmanov said that the decision was unfair and defamatory.  ""I will use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation,"" Usmanov said.  Uzbekistan-born Usmanov was elected unopposed for a fourth term as FIE President last November."

Robertson and Coe roles in doubt following Abramovich's decision to sell Chelsea,"A few days after Roman Abramovich announced that he is ""giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC"", the Russian oligarch has put out a statement saying that the club is for sale.","""As I have stated before, I have always taken decisions with the club's best interest at heart,"" Abramovich said.  ""In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club's sponsors and partners.""  World Athletics President Sebastian Coe is a senior adviser at the club  Among the six trustees named on the club’s website is Sir Hugh Robertson, the former United Kingdom Government Minister who took over the role of British Olympic Association chair from Coe in 2016.  However, there is more uncertainty now with regards to the future of the Chelsea.  The trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation had not responded or agreed to take control of the club and it looks like they will no longer be asked to.  Abramovich has also said that he will not be asking back for any loans the club owes him, and said that a charitable foundation will be set up and the proceeds from the sale will be used to help victims of the war in Ukraine.  ""Please know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the club in this manner,"" Abramovich continued.  ""However, I do believe this is in the best interest of the club.""  The European Union and the west have sanctioned several Russian oligarchs who are linked to President Vladimir Putin, following the invasion of Ukraine, and many have claimed the decision to sell the club has been taken to avoid similar moves by the UK authorities.  The Chelsea Supporters Trust thanked Abramovich for his efforts over the years.  ""The Chelsea Supporters' Trust Board regretfully acknowledges the statement from Roman Abramovich,"" it said.  ""The CST would like to express our gratitude to Mr Abramovich for his affection, passion and dedication towards Chelsea FC.""  Abramovich has loaned more than £1.5 billion ($2 billion/€1.8 billion) to Chelsea.  Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss is reportedly among the people who have been offered a chance to buy the Premier League club.  Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for £140 million ($187 million/€169 million) and since then they have achieved unprecedented success.  The club has won five Premier League titles and the Champions League twice under the Russian's ownership."
Riiber looking to capitalise on home comforts at FIS Nordic Combined World Cup,"Two individual Gundersen events have been planned at the International Ski Federation (FIS) Nordic Combined World Cup in Holmenkollen, Norway, scheduled to begin tomorrow.","Home favourite Jarl Magnus Riiber will look to make the most of the familiar conditions, after what has been a difficult few months with injuries and a COVID-19 infection at the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.  This time, King Harald V or a member of the country's royal family, will be giving away the Kings Cup to each winner.  The tradition is usually a regular during National Championships in a wide range of sports.  However, the decision to involve Nordic combined events was taken after the King’s special request.  Olympic champion Joergen Graabak of Norway will hope to challenge Riiber, who already has three Kings Cups to his name after winning the competition in 2016, 2019 and 2020.  It will be interesting to see if Japan's Akito Watabe, who won bronze in Beijing will be able to add to his collection of four Kings Cups.  Both Riiber and Graabak will be targeting winning the Kings Cup in front of a home crowd.  Germany’s challenge will be headed by individual normal hill gold medallist from Beijing Vinzenz Geiger.

Defending champions England narrowly beaten by Australia in Women's Cricket World Cup thriller,"Australia registered a nervy 12-run win over England in a heavyweight International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s Cricket World Cup match at Seddon Park in Hamilton, New Zealand.","Rachael Haynes starred with an unbeaten 130 runs as Australia finished their innings on 310 for 3.  Chasing the target, defending champions England produced a superb start to their batting reply led by opener Tammy Beaumont before leg-spinner Alana King swung the momentum back Australia’s way.  Nat Sciver then steadied the ship for England with her century but the target proved too much in the end.  Earlier, Australia started slowly as Alyssa Healy was dismissed on 28 after sending a shot straight into the hands of Katherine Brunt.  But a formidable partnership from captain Meg Lanning and Haynes ensured that Australia were on course for setting a strong target.  Lanning finally departed after scoring 86 runs from 110 balls when she found Tammy Beaumont at point as Australia were reduced to 231 for 2 with seven overs remaining.  Haynes’ century came soon after, before she too departed for 130 from 131 balls as she produced a rare, mistimed shot and sent the ball to Danni Wyatt in the deep.  Beth Mooney and new batter Ellyse Perry closed out the innings with four fours from seven balls to take Australia to an imposing final total.  England got off to the worst possible start in reply as opener Lauren Winfield-Hill was dismissed for a fourth-ball duck.  Despite having to wait for 23 balls for the first boundary, captain Heather Knight and Beaumont gave England a much-needed push.  Knight finally fell for 40, caught by Lanning at cover, as England slipped to 92 for two.  Alana King paid the best-possible tribute to Shane Warne as a turning delivery bewitched Beaumont only for Healy to whip off the bails.  Amy Jones was King’s next target before Danni Wyatt was bowled by Tahlia McGrath to leave England at 177 for 5.  While Sciver tried to rescue England out of trouble along with partner Sophia Dunkley, King bowled Dunkley for 28.  Sciver then got her century to give England hope of completing a successful chase.  With 17 to win from the final over, Jess Jonassen produced a remarkable caught and bowled to dismiss Brunt and seal the match for Australia.  Earlier West Indies began the tournament with a three-run win over hosts New Zealand before South Africa avoided an upset as they defeated Bangladesh by 32 runs.  India are due to take on rivals Pakistan in the fourth game of the tournament tomorrow."

India thrash arch-rivals Pakistan to begin Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign,A stellar 122-run seventh-wicket partnership between all-rounders Pooja Vastrakar and Sneh Rana helped India thrash Pakistan by 107 runs to begin their International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign at the Bay Oval in Tauranga.,"At 114 for six, India were struggling to make an impact before Vastrakar and Rana helped them post a competitive 244 for seven.  Pakistan slipped to 98 for seven in their chase as wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh starred with five dismissals on her World Cup debut.  Opting to bat after winning the toss, India got off to a shocking start as Shefali Verma was dismissed for a duck by Diana Baig.  Smriti Mandhana’s patient approach aided India to slowly build the innings, with the 25-year-old opener getting her half-century off 71 balls.  However, the celebrations were cut short as Deepti Sharma was bowled by Nashra Sundhu with the very next ball.  Anam Amin stunned one and all a few moments later as she caught and bowled Mandhana for 52.  New batters Harmanpreet Kaur and Mithali Raj also failed to stay at the crease for long as Kaur was given out lbw for five off 14 balls thanks to Nida Dar.  India slipped to 108 for four and it was youngster Ghosh who departed next for a five-ball duck with Dar picking up her second.  Pakistan dominated with Fatima Sana bagging a maiden over before Sundhu got rid of Raj, who only managed to score nine runs from 36 balls.  At 114 for six, it looked like it was just a matter of moments before India’s tail end folded.  But Vastrakar and Rana had other ideas.  The duo managed to notch up some much-needed boundaries, getting to their highest one day international scores in the process.  In response, Pakistan also started like their arch-rivals as they managed only 26 from the first 10 overs.  Javeria Khan was the first to walk back after a catch from Goswami off the bowling of Rajeshwari Gayakwad.  Skipper Bismah Maroof also failed to inspire her team as she departed soon, scoring only 15 off 24 balls, as Pakistan were reduced to 53 for two.  Rana, who starred with the bat, showed that she can do a thing or two with the ball as well, dismissing Omaima Sohail with her second ball, before Goswami sent Sidra Amin packing after scoring 30 from 64 balls.  In came Aliya Riaz, who had a couple of decent scores during the warm-up games.  But it was just not meant to be as Ghosh stumped her on 11 from 23 balls.  Sana was dismissed next as Pakistan lost their seventh wicket for just 98 runs.  Unfortunately, a seventh-wicket partnership did not do the trick for Pakistan.  Sidra Nawaz and Sundhu failed to support Baig, who was trying her best to keep the tie alive.  However, Meghna Singh’s delivery was caught by Kaur as Baig left the field scoring 24 from 35 balls, with Pakistan all out for 137.  The next game of the World Cup is scheduled to take place tomorrow, with hosts New Zealand up against Bangladesh."

International Handball Federation finally makes statement on Russia and Belarus nearly two weeks after Ukraine invasion,The International Handball Federation (IHF) today finally joined other world governing bodies in banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from taking part in events following the invasion of Ukraine.,"It was the first statement that the IHF had issued on the crisis since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on February 24.  The IHF is the last of the 40 Olympic International Federations to have made an announcement and it comes a week after the International Olympic Committee recommended that Russian and Belarus athletes should not be allowed to compete in events.  ""IHF strongly condemns the actions taken by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and would like to convey their support and solidarity to everyone who is affected by this war situation,"" an IHF statement read.  ""The invasion of Ukraine represents a breach of the Olympic Truce by the Russian government, with a corresponding United Nations (UN) resolution having been signed on 2 December 2021 by consensus of all 193 UN Member States.  ""This breach is not acceptable and, therefore, the IHF Council decided the following.  ""With immediate effect and until further notice, the IHF bans all teams, officials, referees, lecturers and experts from Russia and Belarus from taking part in IHF events and activities.""  This means that Russia, who had qualified for the 2022 IHF Women's Junior and Youth World Championships in Slovenia and the 2022 IHF Men's Beach Handball World Championship in Greece, will not be allowed to participate.  The IHF has also called for the ""involved parties"" to stop the military action to save the lives of citizens.

Bates helps hosts New Zealand grab first win of Women’s Cricket World Cup,New Zealand bounced back from the opening-day defeat against West Indies to register a comfortable nine-wicket win over Bangladesh in a rain-affected International Cricket Council Women’s Cricket World Cup match at Dunedin.,"Suzie Bates stole the show, scoring 79 off 68 balls at the University Oval, to help the White Ferns chase down the opponents score of 140 for eight in a match that was reduced to 27 overs apiece with seven overs to spare.  The win helped lift New Zealand to third in the overall standings behind India and South Africa.  Bates’ half-century was her 28th in one day internationals.  Amelia Kerr, unbeaten on 47, did well to support Bates after Sophie Devine departed after scoring 14 runs.  Vice-captain Amy Satterthwaite played her part with the ball, taking three wickets from five overs.  Satterthwaite’s spell halted the momentum created by Bangladesh openers Fargana Hoque and Shamima Sultana, who managed to score 50 runs without loss.  Frances Mackay got the first wicket to dismiss Sultana when Bangladesh were on 59 before Satterthwaite picked up two wickets in an over to help slow the run rate.  Some clever play from Mackay helped New Zealand run out Hoque before the Bangladesh batting line-up collapsed in quick succession.  Spinner Salma Khatun bagged the only wicket for Bangladesh to dismiss Devine, but it was not of much use as Bates and Kerr chased down the target with ease.  The next game of the World Cup is due to see Australia take on Pakistan tomorrow at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui"

Melissa Pepperkamp of the Netherlands is third with 126.  However, Blouin will not be among the participants in Špindlerův Mlýn.

"UK Prime Minister Johnson remains ""entirely committed"" for home Euro 2028 bid after calls to award tournament to Ukraine","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that he remains ""entirely committed"" in supporting the UK and Ireland’s bid to host UEFA Euro 2028 after he had backed the idea of Ukraine hosting the event earlier.","Johnson also said it was ""beyond satire"" that Russia has expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament.  ""The idea of Russia holding any kind of football tournament, or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,"" he said.  ""The best thing possible would be for the entire Russian armed forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and to hand it to them, of course.""  However, Downing Street later clarified that Johnson was only responding to a question about Moscow's ""brazen and sorely misjudged"" attempt to obtain a platform on the international stage.  ""Clearly we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028 which retains the Government's full backing,"" the Prime Minister's spokesman said.  On February 7, a joint United Kingdom and Ireland bid for Euro 2028 was confirmed after shelving the proposal for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.  The National Federations of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland confirmed the interest in hosting Euro 2028 in a joint statement, citing a feasibility study that analysed the economic impact, ""political football landscape"" and the cost of staging a major international tournament.  ""Hosting a UEFA EURO offers a similar return on investment, with the European tournament carrying a far lower delivery cost and the potential of the benefits being realised sooner,"" the organisations claimed.  ""It would be an honour and a privilege to collectively host UEFA EURO 2028 and to welcome all of Europe.  ""It would also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the true impact of hosting a world-class football tournament by driving positive change and leaving a lasting legacy across our communities.""  While the British Government backed a potential World Cup bid last year, doubts emerged about the feasibility of hosting the event, especially after five failed bids to stage the World Cup since it last hosted in 1966.  It looked like there would be no opposition towards the UK and Ireland’s bid to host the tournament when surprise interests from Russia and Turkey came in before yesterday’s (March 23) UEFA deadline."

It remains to be seen if Chicago Cubs' owner Tom Ricketts and family will make the final list after fans opposed the bid following Islamophobic emails from a member of the family resurfaced.  Coe, however, feels that Broughton is the right man to lead Chelsea in the post-Abramovic era.

""He has the vision, acumen and financial backing to ensure our club’s future success, keeping Chelsea Football Club at the top of European football and challenging for trophies.

"Abramovich victim of ""poisoning"" during Ukraine peace talks","Russian oligarch and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich was the suspected victim of poisoning while trying to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine earlier this month, according to multiple sources.","The billionaire, who has recovered now, reportedly suffered from temporary blindness and peeling skin.  Reports suggest that two Ukrainian peace negotiators were also affected by the incident.  One source has claimed that hardliners in Russia, who did not want the peace talks to proceed, were behind the alleged poisoning incident.  However, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that the incident was due to ""environmental"" factors and not poisoning.  Ukrainian official Ihor Zhovkva told BBC that the Ukrainian delegation were ""fine"" and that he had not spoken with Abramovich.  According to a report on Wall Street Journal, the conditions of Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators, including MP Rustem Umerov, has improved since the incident occurred on March 3.  Bellingcat has revealed that the poisoning attempt was ""not intended to kill"" and ""was just a warning"".  The investigative group also claimed that the symptoms could be a result of attempted poisoning with a chemical weapon.  Abramovich was recently sanctioned by the British Government and the European Union citing his allegedly close relationship with the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin, forcing him to put Chelsea FC on sale.  Abramovich played a crucial role in Russia winning the bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.  The oligarch was also a member of Moscow's delegation to Zurich, where FIFA awarded Russia the right to host the competition twelve years ago.  While Abramovich’s position in the peace talks is not clear, a spokesperson close to the oligarch said that he has ""limited"" influence in the matter.  On Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Abramovich had offered his support to help destabilise the situation in Ukraine.  Zelensky has reportedly asked the US to hold off from sanctioning Abramovich as he could play a key role in negotiations.  However, a source close to the Ukrainian President has said that there are a ""lot of speculations"" and ""conspiracy theories"" surrounding Abramovich’s role in the peace negotiations.  Abramovich has since been spotted at Israel's Tel Aviv airport on 14 March.  The two sides are set for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks in Turkey tomorrow."

While Tammy Beaumont started the England innings in style with a boundary, she was caught behind by Trisha Chetty from the bowling of Marizanne Kapp as England were ten for one.  Heather Knight did not have a good outing as she also departed scoring only one run from 19 balls.  However, Wyatt steadied the ship for England with spinner Chloe Tryon proving to be costly.  But Wyatt’s partner Nat Sciver could not hold on for long as she was dismissed by Shabnim Ismail.  It was Amy Jones who made her way out next from a stunning delivery from Tryon, that ended a 49-run partnership, leaving England at 126 for four.  Dunkley then joined Wyatt in the middle, who was lucky to be dropped at 77 by Lara Goodall, before going on to score her first century at a World Cup.

Meanwhile, Dunkley celebrated her half-century to get England to 250 for five.  With five overs to go, Katherine Brunt was asked to go all out but a smart slow ball from Klaas dismissed her for nine runs.  Ecclestone also helped Dunkley with the bat before the latter departed for 60 as she was trying for big drive to mid-off.  Ecclestone scored three boundaries against Ismail in the final over before eventually bowing out for 24 as England ended with 293 for eight.  Anya Shrubsole, who starred for England in their semi-final against South Africa in 2017, started brilliantly to dismiss tournament top scorer Laura Wolvaardt for a second-ball duck.

Kate Cross send South Africa skipper Sune Luus packing for 21 before Charlie Dean dismissed Goodall for 29 as South Africa were struggling at 67 for four.  Ecclestone then removed Kapp asserting their dominance in the semi-final.

Mignon du Preez became Ecclestone’s third victim, followed by Ismail.  Ecclestone then completed her maiden international five-wicker haul as Klaas was caught behind before sealing the tie by dismissing Chetty and bowl out South Africa for 156 to set-up a mouth-watering final against Australia on Sunday."

""Now they have reached our pentathlete Alexander Lesun, tying his retirement from the sport to the political situation.  ""I think that the British media should already be held accountable for such acts, as fakes like this have already become pervasive and hurt our athletes and our sport."""

""So at this point, we have said ‘let’s see, we can maybe take some young players (to CWG)’ but everyone in the senior core group right now is up for selection.""  In the Commonwealth Games, the men’s team finished as runners up in 2010 and 2014 while the women’s team won the gold in 2002 and silver in 2006."

"Russian gymnast Kuliak appeals against suspension for sporting ""Z"" symbol",Controversial Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak has filed an appeal against the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF) Disciplinary Commission’s decision to suspend him for a year.,"Kuliak wore the letter ""Z"", a symbol associated with Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, during the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) Apparatus World Cup in Doha in March.  He also wore the letter during the medal ceremony for the parallel bars, which was won by Ukrainian Ilia Kovtun.  The FIG reacted angrily at the time, describing Kuliak’s action as ""shocking behaviour"", and Russian athletes were banned from FIG events shortly after.  The GEF then suspended Kuliak, ordered the gymnast to return his bronze medal and prize money of CHF500 (£400/$500/€475) and Kuliak was also ordered to pay costs of CHF2,000 (£1,600/$2,000/€1,900).  ""Mr Kuliak is not allowed to participate in any FIG-sanctioned event or competition organised by an affiliated FIG member federation for one year, as of the date of this decision,"" the disciplinary ruling said.  The panel’s decision was based on the fact that Kuliak ""breached the FIG statutes, the FIG code of discipline, the FIG code of ethics, the FIG code of conduct and the FIG technical regulations when he wore the letter Z on his singlet during the competition and award ceremony.""  However, the athlete has now appealed against the decision, with Russian Artistic Gymnastics Federation (FSGR) President Vasily Titov confirming the same to Russia’s official state news agency TASS.  ""Kuliak filed an appeal with the Gymnastic Ethics Foundation Appeal Tribunal against the decision of the disciplinary commission to disqualify him for one year,"" Titov told TASS.  The FIG also threatened to disqualify two Russian coaches - Valentina Rodionenko and Igor Kalabushkin - for Kuliak 's action.  However, there was no disciplinary ruing by the GEF against them as the panel was not able to find any violations of the FIG rules on their part.  Kuliak was among a group of Russian athletes who attended a ""pro-victory"" rally alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in March.  In early May, Olympic women's artistic team gold medallist Angelina Melnikova was spotted holding a ""Z"" symbol at a Victory Day parade in Voronezh.  Other Russian athletes who supported the war include Olympic gymnastics gold medallist Nikita Nagornyy and two-time Olympic swimming champion Evgeny Rylov, who has ben suspended for nine months by the International Swimming Federation for taking part in a pro-war rally."

BUCS to benefit from Sport England funding to make sport more accessible,British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) is among a group of 120 organisations set to benefit from an investment from Sport England to increase access to sport and physical activity across the nation.,"The move is part of Sport England’s 10-year Uniting the Movement strategy, focused on transforming lives and communities through sport.  BUCS will receive support and investment of £1.34 million (€1.56 million/$1.64 million) of Government and National Lottery funding from Sport England.  Research has shown that certain groups - women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups - are less active and the opportunity to get involved depends on background, gender and postcode.  Through this funding and expertise, BUCS is hoping to make sport more accessible, becoming a leader in tackling inequalities; and supporting universities and colleges reach underrepresented groups.  ""Sport England’s goal is to get everyone active - no matter who they are, where they live, or what their background is,"" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of Sport England, said.  ""But we know that certain groups - such as people on lower incomes - are more likely to be inactive.  ""We can only innovate and tackle inequalities effectively by thinking about long-term change; Uniting the Movement is a long-term vision, and our funding approach needs to reflect that.  ""Changes to our funding model will help us achieve our goal, by making it easier for our partners to do what they need to do to level up and deliver.""  Jenny Morris, BUCS director of delivery, was full of praise for the initiative.  ""This renewed partnership with Sport England is a tremendous endorsement of the work we have been doing and of our long-term vision to make sport and physical activity available to everyone,"" Morris said.  ""We want to showcase the positive impact sport and physical activity has on the lives of young people, and make real headway in ensuring there is equity in access to these benefits for underrepresented groups.  ""We are delighted to be able to partner with Sport England to help achieve this and, in doing so, play our part in achieving their ambitions of tackling inequalities to ensure more people have equal access to sport and physical activity."""

Paris Deputy Mayor Rabadan defends decision to name Porte de La Chapelle Arena after Adidas,Paris Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan has defended the decision to add the name of major sports equipment manufacturer Adidas to a key Paris 2024 venue despite objections from its left-wing allies.,"The Porte de La Chapelle Arena is scheduled to host badminton, Para badminton and Para taekwondo events, during the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The Council of Paris is set to give a ruling on the matter on July 8 and Mayor Anne Hidalgo will have to depend on the right-wing to push the project through.  ""Adidas is very established in France,"" Rabadan was quoted as saying by French publication L'Équipe.  ""Adidas is a sports equipment manufacturer with a strong presence in France and elsewhere, which corresponded to what we wanted to do with this Arena.""  According to L'Équipe, Adidas should pay €2.8 million (£2.4 million/ $2.9 million) per year over five years, with the contract renewable for seven more years, for the naming rights.  Rabadan hopes that this will bring an ""economic balance"" to the 7,800-seat venue.  ""If we create a room and it is not balanced (economically), it will be up to the community to pay,"" Rabadan told L'Équipe.  Currently under construction, the venue is scheduled to be completed by September 2023.  A decision on the naming rights for the venue was made by the SAE POPB Board in May.  According to French newspaper Le Monde, the venue was approved to be named ""Adidas - La Chapelle District.""  However, the communists have accused Mayor Hidalgo of a ""reversal"" after the Paris Council had voted in favour of a proposal in 2020 to name the venue after Alice-Milliat, as a tribute to the popular women's sport activist.  The Alice-Milliat Foundation along with Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, President of the communist and citizen group on the Paris Council, had launched a campaign in May to name the venue after Milliat."

CAS registers appeal against re-election of Eliasch as FIS President,"The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered an appeal filed by four countries against the International Ski Federation’s (FIS) elections last month, which saw Johan Eliasch re-elected as President.","The National Federations of Austria, Germany, Croatia, and Switzerland had challenged the vote held in Milan last week.  ""The four national federations seek the annulment of the Challenged Decision on the grounds that the election was faulty,"" a CAS statement read.  ""A CAS arbitration has commenced.  ""The parties will exchange written submissions while an Arbitral Panel is appointed to decide the matter.  ""It is for the Panel, once appointed, to issue directions with respect to a hearing.  ""At this time, it is not possible to indicate when the final decision will be issued.""  The four nations wanted CAS to review the proceedings of the FIS Congress 2022 as a ""precautionary measure"" and felt that ""procedural motions that were obviously formulated according to democratic principles and correctly submitted or brought forward were not admitted by the external FIS legal counsel"".  Eliasch was re-elected for another four-year term without challenge on May 26, where members from major skiing nations walked out during the Congress.  The choices on the ballot was a major issue with only Eliasch’s name included.  German Ski Federation member Stefan Schwarzbach said that the option to vote for one ""does not correspond to our understanding of the law and is only a farce"".  In June last year, Eliasch was voted in to complete the term of the retiring incumbent Gian-Franco Kasper, with a landslide win against three other candidates.  Last month, the billionaire from London gained 70 out of 100 votes despite the walkouts.  Since being elected, the official has faced scrutiny after announcing his plans to centralise centralise the marketing of FIS World Cup events, stripping member association of its rights.  The FIS has however maintained that the election was run according to the rules.  ""So far, no details or request for relief have been presented by the four national member associations,"" the FIS said.  ""For the Presidential election, no national member association had proposed any other candidate and the incumbent FIS President Johan Eliasch stood for re-election unopposed.  ""During the FIS 2022 Congress, delegates from the four appealing national member associations solicited other member nations to not participate in the election process.  ""Nevertheless, the required presence quorum was not compromised, and Mr Eliasch was re-elected with an absolute majority of the votes of all national member associations, including those who left the room and decided not to vote.  ""FIS is confident that the proceedings of the FIS 2022 Congress were held in strict compliance with the FIS statutes and Swiss law, as confirmed by FIS legal advisors.  ""Furthermore, FIS believes that the allegations put forward by the four national member associations are entirely without merit or substance."""

Hosts England to take on Austria in Manchester at 2022 UEFA Women's EURO opener,"Hosts England will take on Austria at Old Trafford as the 2022 UEFA Women's EURO gets underway tomorrow, with a record-breaking 500,000 tickets already sold for the tournament.","A total of 16 nations will try to become the champions of Europe over the next three weeks with the final set to be held at the Wembley Stadium on July 31.  Norway and Norther Ireland join the hosts and Austria in group A while Spain, Finland, Germany and Denmark will fight it out in group B.  Defending champions The Netherlands are in group C with Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden.  The final group D will feature France, Italy, Belgium, and Iceland.  There is a lot of pressure for England to deliver with the Lionesses in stellar form after the arrival of Sarina Wiegman as head coach last year.  England are on a 14-game unbeaten run under the Dutch coach, who knows a thing or two about winning the tournament, after helping her nation to victory on home soil five years ago.  Austria, who lost to England when they met in World Cup qualifying in November, will be hoping to cause an upset in the opener.  Group A opponents and two-time winners Norway will be looking at former Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg for inspiration, while Northern Ireland are set for their debut in the tournament.  In what is potentially the group of death, Spain with a strong squad featuring FC Barcelona Femení players, who were dominating club football until losing the Champions League final to Lyon in May, will be the team to beat.  Eight-time winners Germany are nowhere near their best and have had a forgettable few months, including a 3-2 loss to Serbia in the World Cup qualifier in April.  Chelsea’s Pernille Harder will lead 2017 finalists Denmark in group B.  With Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema and Lieke Martens of Paris Saint-Germain up front, the holders have arguably the best attack of the tournament.  Sweden, the highest-ranked team in the tournament, will rely on Chelsea’s Magdalena Eriksson, Kosovare Asllani of AC Milan and Barcelona’s Fridolina Rolfo.  Portugal who replaced Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, will have to cause an upset along with Switzerland, if they are to reach the knockout stage.  France, with Lyon players riding high on confidence, will start as favourites despite not even making it to the last-four at EURO.  Italy, on the other hand, will be keen on building from the quarter-final finish at the 2019 World Cup with Iceland and Belgium standing in the way."

Italian Olympian Laura Rogora and home favourite Manon Hily will be looking for a podium finish after missing out in Villars.  Among men, Japan’s Taisei Homma, who earned his first World Cup win in the men’s lead event in Villars, is the one to look out for.  Prior to that, the Japanese had won a silver in Xiamen in 2019 and missed out on the podium in the first Lead World Cup event in Innsbruck last weekend.  The United States’ Jesse Grupper and Colin Duffy, who are in fine form this season, are medal contenders once again.  Grupper bagged silver in Villars and Duffy settled for bronze.  Duffy is in sublime form after becoming the first man to win boulder and lead titles when he won it in Innsbruck.

Chile join the four teams in group A while defending champions Brazil will play against Peru, Venezuela, Argentina, and Uruguay in group B.  Colombia will be counting on home advantage with their toughest opponent in the group stage mostly being Chile.  The hosts won 5-1 when they faced opening day opponents Paraguay in the last edition of the tournament.  Ecuador and Paraguay are also improving while Bolivia looks like the weakest side in group A.  Brazil’s match against Argentina in group B will be a blockbuster as always.  Uruguay against Venezuela will also be interesting as both teams look to qualify for the Olympics and the World Cup for the first time.  Both teams are in good form with wins over Chile and Bolivia right before the tournament.

India brush past Pakistan for first cricket win at Birmingham 2022 and Australia reach semi-finals,"India eased to a comfortable eight-wicket win over Pakistan in their second Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games cricket match here, before Australia brushed aside Barbados and booked their spot in the semi-finals.","An on-and-off drizzle meant that the much-awaited India-Pakistan game was delayed by almost an hour and reduced to 18 overs per side.  Pakistan opted to bat after winning the toss and were bowled out for 99.  An unbeaten 63 from Smriti Mandhana, who starred alongside Shafali Verma with a 61-run opening partnership, helped India to their first victory of the Commonwealth Games with 38 balls remaining.  India have now won 10 of their last 12 T20 international meetings against their neighbours.  Pakistan did not have the best of starts with the bat.  Renuka Singh, who bagged four wickets in the previous game against Australia, started with a maiden over to trouble opener Muneeba Ali.  It took only three balls for Meghna Singh, who took over from Renuka Singh, to get the early breakthrough for India with Iram Javed edging one cheaply.  Skipper Bismah Maroof and Ali then steadied the ship for Pakistan with a fifty-run second-wicket partnership before Sneh Rana trapped Maroof leg before wicket.  Rana then sent Ali packing with a brilliant caught and bowled a couple of deliveries later as Pakistan were reeling at 51 for three after nine overs.  Radha Yadav joined Rana later with two wickets as the Pakistan batting order crumbled over the next nine overs to finish with 99 on the scoreboard.  ""It is a special feeling,"" Sneh Rana said after the game.  ""Whatever we had planned, it all worked out.  ""It is always a special feeling to play against Pakistan.  ""It is fun playing in front of a huge crowd.  ""It is always a great feeling when someone is cheering for you.""  In their chase, Mandhana and Verma were so dominant that it almost looked like batting practice at one point.  The duo showed no mercy with some fine boundaries to add to the joy of the Indian fans at Edgbaston with Anam Amin and Fatima Sana being the most-expensive bowlers for Pakistan.  Tuba Hassan, who stepped in at 52 for no loss, was welcomed with a four each by Mandhana and Verma before the latter edged one to the wicketkeeper in what was a much-needed moment of relief for Pakistan.  While Omaima Sohail manged to get Sabbhineni Meghana out towards the end, it was nothing more than a consolation as Mandhana completed the formalities.  ""I have played a lot in England but I haven’t played a lot in Birmingham - it was a little different condition here,"" Mandhana said.  ""In the last few years, we have got considerable amount of support from our fans wherever we play but during India versus Pakistan, the numbers are even more.  ""We all enjoy it, and all the players enjoy it when we play in front of a big crowd.  ""It kind of motivates you whenever there is a catch taken, whenever there is a four or a six.  ""It is something that is really special, and I would like all the fans to come out in big numbers in all our matches because that is definitely going to motivate the whole team.""  In the day's second match - played in glorious sunshine for the most part - Barbados were inserted to bat and started positively, but wobbled after openers Hayley Matthews and Deandra Dottin departed.  Matthews made a brisk 18, but Barbados collapsed from 37 for one to 64 all out.  Alana King was the pick of the bowlers, with four wickets, but was cruelly denied becoming the first woman to take a Commonwealth Games hat-trick when captain Lanning dropped a routine catch.  King's figures - four overs, one maiden, four wickets for eight runs - were her best in international T20 cricket.  Lanning starred with the bat in a chase Australia made look simple.  She hit the winning runs and also launched Dottin for back-to-back sixes in an over which went for 25 runs as Australia chased the target within nine overs, for the loss of only one wicket.  With two wins from two, Australia are into the final four with a match to spare.  Barbados will face India in a winner-takes-all final group match, but India hold the far superior net run rate."

Women's rights are severely restricted in Saudi Arabia and this has often been highlighted by critics of the regime.  Officials previously claimed that hosting the 2027 men's Asian Cup - a tournament the country is also bidding for - would accelerate the growth of women's football.  China are the defending champions after they beat South Korea 3-2 at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai this year."
